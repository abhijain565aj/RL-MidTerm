This is my Repo for midterm SOC Project submission in topic: Deep Reinforcement learning for stock trading

In the first half we have implemented DQN in solving games from gym, I used the game CartPole V0 for the purpose.

There are two files..with different hyoerparameters but both were pretty succesfully in training the cartpole game, at the end both were able to sustain for very high time. 

The RL_CartPole 200 is the main file to be considered.
